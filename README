This is a small library that can be used to verify gpg signatures.
It is based on the former internal RPM OpenPGP parser, split out
of the rpm tree after twenty years of service.

This software can also be built as part of RPM (in-tree build).
For this to work it needs to be unpacked into the rpmio/ directory
of rpm's sources and rpm's cmake needs to be run with
`-DWITH_SEQUOIA=OFF -DWITH_LEGACY_OPENPGP=ON`

Use entirely at your own risk, the RPM project does not provide support
for this parser.
